## Multimodal AI Bias Detection & Mitigation using Federated Learning

## Overview

This project presents a privacy-preserving framework to detect and
reduce bias in AI systems used in real-world domains such as hiring,
finance, and automated decision-making. The system leverages multimodal
data and federated learning to ensure fairness while keeping sensitive
data secure.

## ❓ Problem Statement

AI models often inherit bias from historical or imbalanced data, leading
to unfair outcomes across demographic groups. At the same time,
collecting sensitive data centrally raises privacy and compliance
concerns.

This project addresses both challenges by detecting bias across multiple
data types while preserving privacy using federated learning.

## 🧩 Key Concepts

### 🔹 Multimodal AI

The framework works with multiple data modalities, including: - Text
data (e.g., resumes, reviews, reports) - Numerical data (e.g., scores,
historical decisions) - Categorical attributes (used carefully for
fairness evaluation)

### 🔹 Federated Learning

Federated learning enables multiple participants to collaboratively
train a shared model without sharing raw data. Each participant trains
locally, and only model updates are aggregated, ensuring privacy and
regulatory compliance.

## ⚙️ System Workflow

1.  Local model training on private data
2.  Secure aggregation of model updates
3.  Bias detection using fairness metrics
4.  Bias mitigation techniques applied
5.  Evaluation and monitoring

## 📊 Fairness Metrics
